# Angular Skeleton by Marco Mattes


# About 
My version of an Angular skeleton.

Was new:

- Jest as test runner
- Cypress for integration testing (E2E).
- Deploying stylelint & eslint settings & rules. 
- CI Mode & Scripts
- Angular 12

Easy to fork, easy to clone 

# CI

Use `:ci` commands for pipelines

Test: `npm run test:ci`
E2E: `npm run e2e:ci`



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also
use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag
for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out
